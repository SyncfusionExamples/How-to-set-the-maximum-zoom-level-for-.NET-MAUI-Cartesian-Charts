# How to set the maximum zoom level for .NET MAUI Cartesian Charts

This repository contains a sample project demonstrating how to set maximum zoom level for a .NET MAUI Toolkit using Syncfusion controls. 

**Cartesian Chart**

A [Cartesian chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts) uses a rectangular coordinate system to plot data points on an X and Y axis. 

By customizing the [Maximum Zoom Level](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui-toolkit/cartesian-charts/zooming-and-panning#maximum-zoom-level) in [ChartZoomPanBehavior](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui-toolkit/Syncfusion.Maui.Toolkit.Charts.ChartZoomPanBehavior.html), can control the extent of zooming allowed on charts, enhancing the user experience and maintaining the integrity of the chart's data representation.

In this example, we will explore how to set Maximum Zoom Level for Cartesian Chart in .NET MAUI Toolkit.
